/*
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 1.0 - Initial release
 * 1.1 - Made empty cells get initialized with 0xffff... instead of zeros
 *       when the simulation starts. This makes things more consistent with
 *       the way the output buf is treated for self-replication, though
 *       the initial state rapidly becomes irrelevant as the simulation
 *       gets going.  Also made one or two very minor performance fixes.
 * 1.2 - Added statistics for execution frequency and metabolism, and made
 *       the visualization use 16bpp color.
 * 1.3 - Added a few other statistics.
 * 1.4 - Replaced SET with KILL and changed EAT to SHARE. The SHARE idea
 *       was contributed by Christoph Groth (http://www.falma.de/). KILL
 *       is a variation on the original EAT that is easier for cells to
 *       make use of.
 * 1.5 - Made some other instruction changes such as XCHG and added a
 *       penalty for failed KILL attempts. Also made access permissions
 *       stochastic.
 * 1.6 - Made cells all start facing in direction 0. This removes a bit
 *       of artificiality and requires cells to evolve the ability to
 *       turn in various directions in order to reproduce in anything but
 *       a straight line. It also makes pretty graphics.
 * 1.7 - Added more statistics, such as original lineage, and made the
 *       genome dump files CSV files as well.
 * 1.8 - Fixed LOOP/REP bug reported by user Sotek.  Thanks!  Also
 *       reduced the default mutation rate a bit.
 * 1.9 - Added a bunch of changes suggested by Christoph Groth: a better
 *       coloring algorithm, right click to switch coloring schemes (two
 *       are currently supported), and a few speed optimizations. Also
 *       changed visualization so that cells with generations less than 2
 *       are no longer shown.
 * 2.0 - Ported to SDL2 by Charles Huber, and added simple pthread based
 *       threading to make it take advantage of modern machines.

/*
 * Nanopond is just what it says: a very very small and simple artificial
 * life virtual machine.
 *
 * It is a "small evolving program" based artificial life system of the same
 * general class as Tierra, Avida, and Archis.  It is written in very tight
 * and efficient C code to make it as fast as possible, and is so small that
 * it consists of only one .c file.
 *
 * How Nanopond works:
 *
 * The Nanopond world is called a "pond."  It is an NxN two dimensional
 * array of Cell structures, and it wraps at the edges (it's toroidal).
 * Each Cell structure consists of a few attributes that are there for
 * statistics purposes, an energy level, and an array of POND_DEPTH
 * four-bit values.  (The four-bit values are actually stored in an array
 * of machine-size words.)  The array in each cell contains the genome
 * associated with that cell, and POND_DEPTH is therefore the maximum
 * allowable size for a cell genome.
 *
 * The first four bit value in the genome is called the "logo." What that is
 * for will be explained later. The remaining four bit values each code for
 * one of 16 instructions. Instruction zero (0x0) is NOP (no operation) and
 * instruction 15 (0xf) is STOP (stop cell execution). Read the code to see
 * what the others are. The instructions are exceptionless and lack fragile
 * operands. This means that *any* arbitrary sequence of instructions will
 * always run and will always do *something*. This is called an evolvable
 * instruction set, because programs coded in an instruction set with these
 * basic characteristics can mutate. The instruction set is also
 * Turing-complete, which means that it can theoretically do anything any
 * computer can do. If you're curious, the instruciton set is based on this:
 * http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/
 *
 * At the center of Nanopond is a core loop. Each time this loop executes,
 * a cycle counter is incremented and one or more things happen:
 *
 * - Every REPORT_FREQUENCY cycle ticks a line of comma seperated output
 *   is printed to STDOUT with some statistics about what's going on.
 * - Every INFLOW_FREQUENCY cycle ticks a random x,y location is picked,
 *   energy is added (see INFLOW_RATE_MEAN and INFLOW_RATE_DEVIATION)
 *   and it's genome is filled with completely random bits.  Statistics
 *   are also reset to generation==0 and parentID==0 and a new cell ID
 *   is assigned.
 * - Every tick a random x,y location is picked and the genome inside is
 *   executed until a STOP instruction is encountered or the cell's
 *   energy counter reaches zero. (Each instruction costs one unit energy.)
 *
 * The cell virtual machine is an extremely simple register machine with
 * a single four bit register, one memory pointer, one spare memory pointer
 * that can be exchanged with the main one, and an output buffer. When
 * cell execution starts, this output buffer is filled with all binary 1's
 * (0xffff....). When cell execution is finished, if the first byte of
 * this buffer is *not* 0xff, then the VM says "hey, it must have some
 * data!". This data is a candidate offspring; to reproduce cells must
 * copy their genome data into the output buffer.
 *
 * When the VM sees data in the output buffer, it looks at the cell
 * adjacent to the cell that just executed and checks whether or not
 * the cell has permission (see below) to modify it. If so, then the
 * contents of the output buffer replace the genome data in the
 * adjacent cell. Statistics are also updated: parentID is set to the
 * ID of the cell that generated the output and generation is set to
 * one plus the generation of the parent.
 *
 * A cell is permitted to access a neighboring cell if:
 *    - That cell's energy is zero
 *    - That cell's parentID is zero
 *    - That cell's logo (remember?) matches the trying cell's "guess"
 *
 * Since randomly introduced cells have a parentID of zero, this allows
 * real living cells to always replace them or eat them.
 *
 * The "guess" is merely the value of the register at the time that the
 * access attempt occurs.
 *
 * Permissions determine whether or not an offspring can take the place
 * of the contents of a cell and also whether or not the cell is allowed
 * to EAT (an instruction) the energy in it's neighbor.
 *
 * If you haven't realized it yet, this is why the final permission
 * criteria is comparison against what is called a "guess." In conjunction
 * with the ability to "eat" neighbors' energy, guess what this permits?
 *
 * Since this is an evolving system, there have to be mutations. The
 * MUTATION_RATE sets their probability. Mutations are random variations
 * with a frequency defined by the mutation rate to the state of the
 * virtual machine while cell genomes are executing. Since cells have
 * to actually make copies of themselves to replicate, this means that
 * these copies can vary if mutations have occurred to the state of the
 * VM while copying was in progress.
 *
 * What results from this simple set of rules is an evolutionary game of
 * "corewar." In the beginning, the process of randomly generating cells
 * will cause self-replicating viable cells to spontaneously emerge. This
 * is something I call "random genesis," and happens when some of the
 * random gak turns out to be a program able to copy itself. After this,
 * evolution by natural selection takes over. Since natural selection is
 * most certainly *not* random, things will start to get more and more
 * ordered and complex (in the functional sense). There are two commodities
 * that are scarce in the pond: space in the NxN grid and energy. Evolving
 * cells compete for access to both.
 *
 * If you want more implementation details such as the actual instruction
 * set, read the source. It's well commented and is not that hard to
 * read. Most of it's complexity comes from the fact that four-bit values
 * are packed into machine size words by bit shifting. Once you get that,
 * the rest is pretty simple.
 *
 * Nanopond, for it's simplicity, manifests some really interesting
 * evolutionary dynamics. While I haven't run the kind of multiple-
 * month-long experiment necessary to really see this (I might!), it
 * would appear that evolution in the pond doesn't get "stuck" on just
 * one or a few forms the way some other simulators are apt to do.
 * I think simplicity is partly reponsible for this along with what
 * biologists call embeddedness, which means that the cells are a part
 * of their own world.
 *
 * Run it for a while... the results can be... interesting!
 *
 * Running Nanopond:
 *
 * Nanopond can use SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) for screen output. If
 * you don't have SDL, comment out USE_SDL below and you'll just see text
 * statistics and get genome data dumps. (Turning off SDL will also speed
 * things up slightly.)
 *
 * After looking over the tunable parameters below, compile Nanopond and
 * run it. Here are some example compilation commands from Linux:
 *
 * For Pentiums:
 *  gcc -O6 -march=pentium -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -s
 *   -o nanopond nanopond.c -lSDL
 *
 * For Athlons with gcc 4.0+:
 *  gcc -O6 -msse -mmmx -march=athlon -mtune=athlon -ftree-vectorize
 *   -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -o nanopond nanopond.c -lSDL
 *
 * The second line is for gcc 4.0 or newer and makes use of GCC's new
 * tree vectorizing feature. This will speed things up a bit by
 * compiling a few of the loops into MMX/SSE instructions.
 *
 * This should also work on other Posix-compliant OSes with relatively
 * new C compilers. (Really old C compilers will probably not work.)
 * On other platforms, you're on your own! On Windows, you will probably
 * need to find and download SDL if you want pretty graphics and you
 * will need a compiler. MinGW and Borland's BCC32 are both free. I
 * would actually expect those to work better than Microsoft's compilers,
 * since MS tends to ignore C/C++ standards. If stdint.h isn't around,
 * you can fudge it like this:
 *
 * #define uintptr_t unsigned long (or whatever your machine size word is)
 * #define uint8_t unsigned char
 * #define uint16_t unsigned short
 * #define uint64_t unsigned long long (or whatever is your 64-bit int)
 *
 * When Nanopond runs, comma-seperated stats (see doReport() for
 * the columns) are output to stdout and various messages are output
 * to stderr. For example, you might do:
 *
 * ./nanopond >>stats.csv 2>messages.txt &
 *
 * To get both in seperate files.
 *
 * Have fun!
